# PhoneGap plugin for Couchbase Lite

Couchbase Lite is an embedded JSON database for occasionally connected devices. It syncs data in the background, so users can collaborate across devices. There is an event based `_changes` JSON feed API so you can drive data-binding UI frameworks like Sencha and Backbone to reflect remote updates interactively.

It works with native code as well as Cordova / PhoneGap on iOS and Android (you can even sync with Mac desktops), so it doesn't matter where your users are, they can work with the data, and as soon as they get back online, everyone will see their changes.

## Quick start

You install LiteGap into your PhoneGap app using [the PhoneGap command line tools](https://github.com/phonegap/phonegap-cli/) and this command (where `$PLATFORM` is either `ios` or `android`):

```
npm install -g phonegap
phonegap create MyPhoneGapApp
cd MyPhoneGapApp/
phonegap local plugin add https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase-Lite-PhoneGap-Plugin.git
phonegap run $PLATFORM
```

Congrats, you got to hello world. If you want to try a full example app, [follow the instructions for 5 minutes to awesome](http://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/cbl-phonegap/#getting-started-in-5-minutes)

## Architecture

This is where the plugin fits in the picture:

_Note:_ your JavaScript code can also directly communicate with Couchbase Lite over a Javascript<->Native bridge, to [ask it what URL it has launched on for subsequent XHR access](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/LiteGap/blob/master/www/litegap-example.html)

## Updating this repo

This repo is a git mirror of the [zip file produced by this Jenkins job](http://factory.couchbase.com/view/build/view/mobile_dev/job/package_phonegap_plugin/). When there is a release, you need to do this to push it to github:

1. Download and uncompress the zip.
2. Clone this repo.
3. Copy the `.git/` directory from your clone of this repo into the unzipped build.
4. Vist this repo on the github website and adjust the settings to make a branch other than `master` into the Default Branch.
5. Delete the master branch from github with `git push origin :master` from inside the unzipped build.
6. Create a new branch `pendingmaster`  with `git checkout -b pendingmaster`
7. Check all your stuff into it with `git add --all` and `git commit`
8. Delete your local master with `git branch -D master`
9. Create a new local master without any history using `git checkout --orphan master`
10. `git commit -m "new plugin bundle"`
11. Publish the new branch with `git push origin master`
12. Visit this repo on the github website and adjust the settings to make `master` into the Default Branch again.

### Publishing to Cordova

    npm install -g plugman

From inside the package directory `plugman adduser` and `plugman publish .`

# Where to go from here

There's an [example chat app with PhoneGap](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/CouchChat-PhoneGap) that illustrates the channel sync API. You can [read more about the app here](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/CouchChat-PhoneGap).

If you made it this far, you are now ready to build your custom PhoneGap App by editing the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files under the www directory.  Your same application code will work on both the iOS and Android platforms!
